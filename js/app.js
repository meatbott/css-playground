/*The rough idea is that I can create different examples of CSS manipulation and display them as a grid
so that I might reference them later. I have found that sometimes I forget how I did certain things and
googling it proves difficult occasionally so this will be a more solid reference. That is the idea anyway.

  Examples being animations, repeating/looping animations, gradients, changing fonts, movement of elements,
  shape drawing/svgs, interactive elements/UX enhanement, color changing/flashing

  Each "card" should feature something different and useful if not interesting.

/*TODO: Use a master array to help with looping...or create adhoc array to hold objects 

        Implement internal storage system-Objects in the data.js file
          components
            Title
            name
            content- sub divs/elements to manipulate
            background color/image
            order/date/time of creation
            buttons

        Create functions that pull from aforementioned Objects to generate DOM elements
          generic inputs
          Maybe there is a better way to do this but I am not sure right now.

        Ulitlize local storage for customization/practice using local storage

        Think about types of css class archetypes instead of individual classes, broader instead of narrower, as
        applicable. This is probably more useful when doing a project that is not focused on CSS but I want to
        still try to make it work.

        I should be able to ideally make a new object in data.js file by writing in the file that will populate
        a new "card". If I was really good I could make a new object by typing into a text field in the actual
        webpage. This is for later but it is good to think about.
